<h1>The First Day of School</h1>

<p>
    One very nice morning near the end of summer,
    my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake
    up and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your
    first day of school and you can't be late." I groaned in
    my bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got
    dressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.noun) with a collar on it, a red tie,
    dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n)
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.adjective) hat. In ten minutes I made
    lunch and ate my breakfast. @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.number)
    minutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I
    was at school.
    In school, I met two really
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.adjective2) kids. All of us became
    friends very fast. That day we had Science, and
    luckily my friends and I were at the same
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.noun2). My friends' names are
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPr) and
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPr2). In Math we weren't
    together, and that really bugged me. We learned what
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPl) were, and when to use
    them. At snack and recess, we played a game
    together. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.verb) off of the ropes onto
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPl2). I thought it was a very
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.adjective3) idea. In swimming class,
    we needed to swim extremely
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.adverb), or else we would have to
    swim longer.
    Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all
    my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two
    minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I
    shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to
    my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was
    back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!
