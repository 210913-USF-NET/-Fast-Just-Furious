<h1>The Fun Park!</h1>

<p>
    Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an)
    @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.adjective) amusement park. It was a
    fun park with lots of cool @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.nounPl)
    and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my
    kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the
    @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.noun)." We all pushed out in a terrible
    hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and
    we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out
    what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller
    coaster I really liked so, I @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.adverb) ran
    over to get in the long line that had about
    @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.number) people in it. When I finally
    got on the roller coaster I was @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.verbPt).
    In fact I was so nervous my two knees
    were knocking together. This was the @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.adjective2)
    ride I had ever been on! In about two
    minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears.
    That’s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom,
    I was a little @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.verbPt2) but I
    was proud of myself. The rest of the day went
    @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.verbPt2). It was a(n) @Html.DisplayFor(Model => Model.adverb2)
    day at the fun park.
