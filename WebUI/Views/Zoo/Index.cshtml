<h1>Day at the Zoo</h1>

<p>
    Today I went to the zoo. I saw a(n) @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective)
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.noun) jumping up and down in its tree.
    He @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verbPt) @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adverb)
    through the large tunnel that led to its  @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective2)
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.noun2). I got some peanuts and passed
    them through the cage to a gigantic gray @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.noun3)
    towering above my head. Feeding that animal made
    me hungry. I went to get a @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective3) scoop
    of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verb) @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adverb2) to catch our bus.
    When I got home I @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verbPt2) my
    mom for a @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective4) day at the zoo.
