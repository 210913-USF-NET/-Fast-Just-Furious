<h1>The Monkey King!</h1>

<p>
    The day I saw the Monkey King @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.verb) was one of the most
    interesting days of the year.
    After he did that, the king played chess on his brother's
    @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.verb) and then combed his @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.adjective) hair with a
    comb made out of old fish bones. Later that same day, I saw the
    Monkey King dance @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.adverb)
    in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats.
