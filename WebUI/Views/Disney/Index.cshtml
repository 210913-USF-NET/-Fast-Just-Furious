<h1>My Trip To Disney World!</h1>

<p>
    Last month, I went to Disney World with  @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.name) . We
    traveled for @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.number) by  @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.vehicle). Finally, we
    arrived and it was very @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective). There were
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective2) people @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verb) everywhere. There
    were also people dressed up in @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.animal) costumes.
    I wish it had been more@Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective3), but we @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verbPt) anyway.
    We also went on a(n) @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.adjective4) ride
    called Magic (noun). @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.name2) nearly fell off a ride and had to be
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verbPt2). Later, we went to the hotel and
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verbPt3). Next year, I want to go to @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.place),
    where we can @Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.verb2).
