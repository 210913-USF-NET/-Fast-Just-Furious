<h1>At The Arcade!</h1>

<p>
    When I go to the arcade with my @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPl)
    there are lots of games to play. I spend
    lots of time there with my friends. In the game X-Men
    you can be different @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPl2). The
    point of the game is to @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.verb) every
    robot. You also need to save people. Then you can
    go to the next level.
    In the game Star Wars you are Luke Skywalker
    and you try to destroy every @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.noun). In
    a car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat
    every computerized vehicle that you are
    @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.verb2) against.
    There are a whole lot of other cool games. When
    you play some games you win @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPl3)
    for certain scores. Once you're done you can
    cash in your tickets to get a big @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.noun2). You
    can save your @Html.DisplayNameFor(Model => Model.nounPl4) for
    another time. When I went to this arcade I didn't
    believe how much fun it would be. So far I have had a
    lot of fun every time I've been to this great arcade!
